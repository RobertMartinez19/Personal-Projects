## Getting Started

To run this calculator, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Code**: You'll need a C++ compiler to compile the code. You can use a command like `g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator` to compile it. Replace `calculator.cpp` with the name of your source code file if needed.

2. **Run the Program**: After successful compilation, run the program by executing the compiled binary. For example: `./calculator` (or `calculator.exe` on Windows).

3. **Perform Calculations**: Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the operator (+, -, *, or /) and the two numbers you want to calculate.

4. **Repeat or Quit**: After each calculation, you can choose to perform another calculation or quit the program by pressing 'q' followed by Enter.

## Usage

1. Enter the operator you want to use (+, -, *, or /).

2. Enter the first number and press Enter.

3. Enter the second number and press Enter.

4. The program will display the result of the calculation.

## How to Play

- **Player 1 (left side)** controls their paddle with the "W" key (up) and "S" key (down).
- **Player 2 (right side)** controls their paddle with the "Up" arrow key (up) and "Down" arrow key (down).
- Press the "Space" key to pause and resume the game.

## Scoring

- The game starts with a score of 0 for both players.
- Each time the ball passes your opponent's paddle and hits the wall behind them, you score a point.
- The score is displayed at the top center of the game window.

## Customization

You can customize the game by changing various parameters in the code, such as player names, paddle colors, ball speed, and more.

## Player Names

By default, player names are set to "Player 1" and "Player 2". You can change these names by inputting your own names when prompted.

## Changing Paddle Colors

You can customize the paddle colors by changing the `paddle_a.color()` and `paddle_b.color()` functions in the code.

## Ball Speed

Adjust the ball's speed by modifying the `ball.dx` and `ball.dy` variables in the code. Increasing these values will make the ball move faster.

## Background Image

If you want to use a background image for the game, uncomment the code related to the background image by removing the "#" symbol from the relevant lines and provide the file path to your desired image.

## Pause Feature

You can pause and resume the game by pressing the "Space" key. The paused state is indicated at the center of the game window.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to create your own unique Pong experience. Have fun playing, and may the best player win!
